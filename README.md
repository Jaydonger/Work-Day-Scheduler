# Work-Day-Scheduler

# description
This program is a scheduler that allows you to save events to certain timeframes within your workday. They are color coded so that you can schedule your events accordingly. A gray text area means that timeframe has already passed. A red text area indicates a current timeframe. A green text area indicates that timeframe is in the future and does not require immediate attention. You can create events by typing whatever you want to inside the desired text area (preferrably something relevant to the event) and then clicking the corresponding save button. This will save your event to local storage so you can close the page and come back and check on it later!

If you wish to see your local storage simply right click and inspect the page, then navigate to the application tab.
